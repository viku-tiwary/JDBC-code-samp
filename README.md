# JDBC Code Samples

This repository contains sample Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) code for interacting with databases. JDBC is a Java API for connecting and executing queries on a database.

## Code Samples

### [Main.java](src/Main.java)

This file contains a basic example demonstrating how to establish a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC, execute a simple SQL query, and retrieve results.

### [CreateTable.java](src/CreateTable.java)

This file demonstrates how to create a new table in a MySQL database using JDBC.

### [InsertData.java](src/InsertData.java)

This file provides an example of inserting data into a table in a MySQL database using JDBC.

### [RetrieveData.java](src/RetrieveData.java)

This file illustrates how to retrieve data from a table in a MySQL database using JDBC.

### [UpdateData.java](src/UpdateData.java)

This file showcases how to update existing data in a table in a MySQL database using JDBC.

### [DeleteData.java](src/DeleteData.java)

This file demonstrates how to delete data from a table in a MySQL database using JDBC.

## Prerequisites

To run these code samples, you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- MySQL database server installed and running
- MySQL Connector/J library added to your project's classpath

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/viku-tiwary/JDBCCODESAMPLE.git
   ```

2. Compile the Java files using the `javac` command:

   ```
   javac -cp .:mysql-connector-java-<version>.jar src/*.java
   ```

3. Run any of the compiled Java programs using the `java` command:

   ```
   java -cp .:mysql-connector-java-<version>.jar src.Main
   ```

Replace `<version>` with the appropriate version of MySQL Connector/J library.
